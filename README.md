###  Discrete mathematics approach

This uses the y = mx + c approach to forecast new ball locations

### To run program follow the process below:


To clone the work and run the game.ipynb via jupyter notebook having executed the following commands below


``` 
git clone https://github.com/elishatofunmi/pytennis-Deep-Q-Network-DQN-.git

cd "pytennis-Deep-Q-Network-DQN-"

pip install -r requirements.txt

cd Notebook

# go ahead to run 'pytennis notebook (DQN).ipynb' cell by cell via jupyter notebook/ jupyterlab

```



To clone the work and run the main.py file using the following commands below

``` 
git clone https://github.com/elishatofunmi/pytennis-Deep-Q-Network-DQN-.git

cd "pytennis-Deep-Q-Network-DQN-"

pip install -r requirements.txt
